# snakemake-metagenome-workflows
A collection of snakemake-workflows for metagenomics that can be used as modules 


The goal is to write short snakemake workflows that are usefull for metagenomics. Theses workflows can then be integrated in other snakemake workflows as moduels.

What are tools that should be written as modules/ or wrappers? [Let's dicuss here.](https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/snakemake-metagenome-workflows/discussions/1)

Each module should be written as a seperate repository based on the template: https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/snakemake-workflow-template
